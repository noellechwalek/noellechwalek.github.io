			<p> Why is <b>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</b> my favorite video game you may be wondering?</p>

			<p style= "color:forestgreen;"> I love the open world of BoTW and the storyline. I love that you are able to explore the map freely without being tied down to a certain path. The main storyline is amazing as well as the side quests as well. There are so many new characters introduced who are all unique in their own way. I could play this game for hours on end without getting bored. The graphics of this game are jaw-dropping as well. </p>
